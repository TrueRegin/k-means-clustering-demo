# K-Means Clustering Test
Input an image and get 4 colors determined by k-means clustering.

## Premise
K Means clustering is a method that takes in a set of data and than outputs clusters of that data.

The set of data is generally a set of N-dimensional vectors.

The output is a list of clusters. A cluster is simply a subset of vectors that are in the original data set.

In this demo, the goal was to find average colors on an image.

K-means clustering can range from super simple to super complex, but the premise is you are trying to cluster a set of data into more organized sections with more similarity.

Clustering itself likely has many uses so I encourage you to go look into the topic more because I literally just learned this stuff.
